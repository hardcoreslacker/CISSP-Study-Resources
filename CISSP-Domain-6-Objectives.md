### Purpose of Security Assessment and Testing

- **To identify and assess security risks:** Security assessments and tests can help organizations identify and understand the security risks they face. This information can then be used to prioritize security initiatives and allocate resources effectively.
- **To validate the effectiveness of security controls:** Security assessments and tests can help organizations validate that their security controls are working as intended. This is important for ensuring that the organization is protected from known and emerging security threats.
- **To ensure compliance with security requirements:** Many organizations are subject to security requirements imposed by industry regulations, government contracts, or other stakeholders. Security assessments and tests can help organizations ensure that they are meeting these requirements.
- **To provide assurance to stakeholders:** Security assessments and tests can provide assurance to stakeholders that the organization is taking appropriate steps to protect its information assets. This can be important for maintaining customer trust, attracting investors, and retaining top talent.
