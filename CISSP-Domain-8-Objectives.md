[8.3](#8.3) Assess the effectiveness of software security

### Software security assessment methods

- **Static application security testing (SAST):** a type of application security testing that analyzes source code to identify vulnerabilities. SAST is a white-box testing technique, which means that it is performed with knowledge of the application's internal structure and code. This allows SAST tools to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including:
	- Coding errors: These are errors in the code that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the application or its data.
	- Logic flaws: These are flaws in the application's logic that can be exploited by attackers to cause the application to behave unexpectedly or to bypass security controls.
	- Configuration errors: These are errors in the way the application is configured that can make it vulnerable to attack.
- **Dynamic application security testing (DAST):** an automated approach that uses tools to scan web applications for vulnerabilities. DAST tools simulate real-world attacks by sending requests to the application and analyzing the responses to identify potential vulnerabilities. DAST is typically used to identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and insecure direct object references.
- **Penetration testing:** a simulated cyberattack against an application to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. It is a manual process that involves skilled security professionals using a variety of tools and techniques to find and exploit weaknesses in an application. Penetration testers often think like attackers and try to break into the application using the same methods that real attackers would use.
