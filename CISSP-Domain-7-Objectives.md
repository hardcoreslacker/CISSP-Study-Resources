[7.6](#7.6) Conduct incident management

### Introduction

Incident management is the process of detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents. It is a critical part of any organization's security posture, as it helps to minimize the impact of incidents on the organization's systems, data, and reputation.

Incident management is typically carried out by an Incident Response Team (IRT), which is a group of individuals with the necessary skills and experience to respond to security incidents. The IRT is responsible for executing the incident response plan, which is a document that outlines the procedures that will be followed during each phase of the incident response lifecycle.

### Incident Response Lifecycle

- **Detection:** Identifying potential security incidents (e.g., by monitoring security logs, analyzing threat intelligence feeds, and receiving incident reports from users).
- **Analysis:** Gathering and analyzing information about the incident to determine its scope, impact, and root cause (e.g., by interviewing witnesses, collecting and analyzing evidence, and reviewing system logs).
- **Containment:** Limiting the impact of the incident and preventing further damage (e.g., by isolating affected systems, changing passwords, and implementing security controls).
- **Eradication:** Removing the cause of the incident (e.g., by removing malware, patching vulnerabilities, and disabling compromised accounts).
- **Recovery:** Restoring systems and data to their normal state (e.g., by restoring from backups, rebuilding systems, and re-enabling compromised accounts).
- **Lessons Learned:** Documenting the incident and learning from it to improve future responses (e.g., by identifying areas where the incident response process can be improved and by sharing lessons learned with other organizations).

### Incident Response Team (IRT)

- **Composition:** An IRT should be composed of individuals with the necessary skills and experience to respond to a variety of security incidents. This may include security analysts, incident responders, forensic investigators, and public relations professionals.
- **Organization:** The IRT should be organized in a way that allows for effective communication and collaboration. This may involve establishing a clear chain of command and defining the roles and responsibilities of each team member.
- **Training:** IRT members should be trained regularly on the incident response plan and on the latest security threats and vulnerabilities. This will help them to respond to incidents quickly and effectively.
- **Testing:** The IRT should regularly test the incident response plan to ensure that it is effective and that team members are familiar with their roles and responsibilities. This can be done through table-top exercises, simulations, and live-fire drills.

### Incident Response Plan

- **Scope:** The incident response plan should define the types of incidents that are covered by the plan and the severity levels of those incidents. It should also identify the stakeholders who will be involved in the incident response process.
- **Responsibilities:** The incident response plan should define the roles and responsibilities of each team member during an incident response. This will help to ensure that everyone knows what they are supposed to do and that tasks are not duplicated.
- **Procedures:** The incident response plan should outline the procedures that will be followed during each phase of the incident response lifecycle. This will help to ensure that the incident response process is consistent and effective.
- **Communications:** The incident response plan should define how the IRT will communicate with each other and with other stakeholders during an incident. This may involve establishing communication channels and developing templates for incident reports.
- **Escalation:** The incident response plan should define the process for escalating incidents to higher levels of management. This will ensure that critical incidents are handled appropriately and that the necessary resources are allocated.

### Incident Response Tools and Technologies

- **Security information and event management (SIEM) systems:** SIEM systems collect and analyze security logs from a variety of sources to detect potential incidents.
- **Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platforms:** SOAR platforms automate tasks such as incident triage, investigation, and response. This can help to free up IRT members to focus on more complex tasks.
- **Threat intelligence feeds:** Threat intelligence feeds provide information about current threats and vulnerabilities. This information can be used to improve the detection and prevention of incidents.
- **Forensic tools:** Forensic tools are used to collect and analyze evidence from compromised systems. This evidence can be used to identify the root cause of an incident and to recover from the incident.

### Incident Reporting

- **What to report:** Incident reports should include information such as the date and time of the incident, the type of incident, the impact of the incident, the steps that have been taken to contain and eradicate the incident, and the next steps that will be taken.
- **Who to report to:** Incident reports should be shared with internal stakeholders such as management and legal counsel. They may also need to be shared with external stakeholders such as law enforcement and regulators.
- **When to report:** Incident reports should be submitted as soon as possible after the incident has been detected. This will help to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the incident and that the necessary steps are taken to mitigate the impact of the incident.

### Incident Management Best Practices

- **Proactive approach:** Organizations should develop and maintain an incident response plan and train team members on how to execute the plan. This will help to ensure that the organization is prepared to respond to incidents that do occur.
- **Continuous improvement:** Organizations should review and update their incident response plan regularly based on lessons learned from past incidents. This will help to ensure that the incident response process is constantly improving.
- **Communication and collaboration:** Organizations should communicate effectively with all stakeholders throughout the incident response process. This will help to ensure that everyone is aware of the status of the incident and that the necessary steps are being taken to resolve it.
- **Transparency:** Organizations should be transparent with stakeholders about the status of the incident and the steps being taken to resolve it. This will help to build trust with stakeholders and to minimize the impact of the incident on the organization's reputation.

1. Identify assets: Identify the organization's critical assets, such as data, systems, and people.
1. Identify threats: Identify the threats that could disrupt the organization's operations.
1. Assess vulnerabilities: Assess the vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats.
1. Calculate risk: Calculate the risk of each threat to each asset.
1. Prioritize risks: Prioritize the risks based on their likelihood and impact.

- **Impact analysis:** An impact analysis is the process of assessing the impact of each risk on the organization's business. The impact analysis typically considers the following factors:
	- Financial losses: The cost of downtime, data loss, and other business disruptions.
	- Reputational damage: The impact on the organization's reputation from a disruption.
	- Legal and regulatory compliance: The impact on the organization's ability to comply with laws and regulations in the event of a disruption.
- **Recovery time objectives (RTOs):** RTOs specify the maximum amount of time that the organization can tolerate being down after a disruption. RTOs are typically set based on the organization's critical business processes. For example, an online retailer may have a very short RTO for its e-commerce platform, while a manufacturing company may have a longer RTO for its production lines.
- **Recovery point objectives (RPOs):** RPOs specify the maximum amount of data that the organization can afford to lose in the event of a disruption. RPOs are typically set based on the criticality of the data. For example, an organization may have a very short RPO for its customer database, while it may have a longer RPO for its historical financial data.
- **Recovery team roles and responsibilities:** The recovery team is responsible for developing and implementing the organization's recovery strategies. The recovery team typically includes representatives from all departments of the organization, such as IT, operations, and finance.
- **Recovery plans testing and maintenance:** Recovery plans should be tested regularly to ensure that they are effective and up-to-date. Recovery plans should also be maintained to reflect changes in the organization's environment, such as new systems and processes.

### Recovery Technologies

- **Backup and recovery technologies:** Backup and recovery technologies are used to create copies of data that can be restored in the event of data loss or corruption. Common backup and recovery technologies include:
	- Full backups: Create a complete copy of all data.
	- Incremental backups: Create a copy of the data that has changed since the last backup.
	- Differential backups: Create a copy of the data that has changed since the last full backup.
- **High availability technologies:** High availability technologies are used to reduce downtime and ensure that critical business applications and services are always available. Common high availability technologies include:
	- Load balancing: Distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
	- Clustering: Groups multiple servers together to create a single, highly available system.
	- Failover: Automatically switches to a backup server in the event of a failure.
	- Distributed cloud: workloads are deployed across multiple cloud regions or providers. This allows organizations to maintain availability even if one region or provider experiences an outage.
- **Disaster recovery technologies:** Disaster recovery technologies are used to restore critical business operations and information systems following a disaster. Common disaster recovery technologies include:
	- Hot sites: A hot site is a fully operational backup facility that can be used to immediately resume business operations in the event of a disaster.
	- Cold sites: A cold site is an empty facility that can be equipped with hardware and software to resume business operations following a disaster.
	- Cloud-based DR: Cloud-based DR provides organizations with access to computing resources and data storage in the cloud that can be used to resume business operations following a disaster.

[7.11](#7.11) Implement Disaster Recovery (DR) processes


### Introduction

- **What is disaster recovery?** Disaster recovery is the process of restoring business operations after a disaster. This includes recovering data, systems, and applications, as well as restoring people and procedures.
- **Why is disaster recovery important?** Disaster recovery is important because it can help businesses to minimize the disruption caused by a disaster and to get back to business as quickly as possible.
- **Types of disasters**
	- Natural: hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and wildfires
	- Man-made: cyberattacks, fires, and explosions
- **Phases of disaster recovery:**
	- Preparedness: involves developing a DR plan and implementing the necessary controls to prevent or mitigate the impact of a disaster. The DR plan should identify the critical business processes and systems, the RTOs and RPOs, and the DR strategies that will be used. The DR plan should also include procedures for testing and maintaining the DR plan.
	- Response: begins when a disaster occurs and continues until the immediate threat to life and safety has subsided. The response phase involves assessing the damage caused by the disaster, developing a recovery plan, and implementing the necessary steps to stabilize the situation.
	- Recovery: begins after the immediate threat to life and safety has subsided and continues until the business is fully restored. The recovery phase involves restoring critical business processes and systems, rebuilding damaged infrastructure, and providing financial assistance to affected individuals and businesses.
	- Lessons learned: involves reviewing the DR plan and the response and recovery efforts to identify areas for improvement. The lessons learned from each disaster can be used to improve the DR plan and the response and recovery procedures.

### Developing a DR Plan

- **Risk assessment:** A risk assessment is used to identify the different threats to a business and to assess the likelihood and impact of each threat.
- **Business impact analysis:** A business impact analysis is used to identify the critical business processes and systems and to assess the impact of a disruption to these processes and systems.
- **Recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs):** RTOs and RPOs are used to define the maximum amount of time that a business can afford to be offline and the maximum amount of data that can be lost.
- **DR strategies:** There are a number of different DR strategies that businesses can use, such as on-premises DR, cloud-based DR, and hybrid DR.
- **DR plan testing and maintenance:** It is important to test and maintain DR plans on a regular basis to ensure that they are still effective.

### Implementing DR Processes

- **Data backup and recovery:** Data backup and recovery is a critical part of any DR plan. Businesses need to have a robust data backup and recovery solution in place to ensure that they can recover their data in the event of a disaster.
	- There are a number of different data backup and recovery solutions available, including:
		- On-premises backup and recovery solutions
		- Cloud-based backup and recovery solutions

	- Improved ability to respond to a disaster
	- Reduced downtime and financial losses
	- Improved compliance with regulations
- **Types of DRP tests:**
	- Tabletop exercises: These involve walking through the DRP step-by-step to identify any gaps or weaknesses.
	- Simulation exercises: These involve simulating a real-world disaster and executing the DRP to see how it performs.
	- Full-scale tests: These involve executing the entire DRP from start to finish.
- **How to develop a DRP test plan:** A DRP test plan should include the following elements:
	- Scope of the test: What parts of the DRP will be tested?
	- Objectives of the test: What are the goals of the test?
	- Assumptions and constraints: What assumptions and constraints will apply to the test?
	- Test scenarios: What disaster scenarios will be tested?
	- Participants: Who will participate in the test?
	- Schedule: When will the test be conducted?
	- Budget: What is the budget for the test?

### Planning the DRP Test

- **Scope of the test:** The scope of the test should be determined based on the complexity of the DRP and the organization's risk tolerance. For example, a small organization with a simple DRP may only need to test the notification and incident response procedures. However, a large organization with a complex DRP may need to test all aspects of the plan, including the recovery procedures.
- **Objectives of the test:** The objectives of the test should be specific and measurable. For example, one objective of the test might be to verify that the notification process can be executed within 15 minutes of a disaster. Another objective might be to verify that the recovery procedures can restore critical business functions within 24 hours of a disaster.
- **Assumptions and constraints:** Any assumptions or constraints that apply to the test should be identified and documented in the test plan. For example, one assumption might be that the DRP test will be conducted during normal business hours. Another constraint might be that the test budget is limited.
- **Test scenarios:** The test scenarios should be realistic and representative of the types of disasters that the organization could face. For example, one test scenario might simulate a power outage. Another test scenario might simulate a ransomware attack.
- **Participants:** All key stakeholders should be involved in the DRP test, including IT, business operations, and management.
- **Schedule:** The DRP test should be scheduled for a time when it will have minimal impact on business operations.
- **Budget:** The budget for the DRP test will vary depending on the size and complexity of the organization's DRP. Budget factors to consider include:
	- The scope of the test
	- The complexity of the DRP
	- The cost of any testing tools or resources
	- The cost of labor for staff involved in the test
	- The cost of any disruptions to business operations caused by the test

### Executing the DRP Test

- **Simulating the disaster:** The disaster should be simulated in a realistic manner. This may involve using specialized testing tools or simply simulating the disaster on paper.
- **Implementing the DRP:** The DRP should be implemented according to the test plan. All key stakeholders should follow their assigned roles and responsibilities.
- **Monitoring and evaluating the test:** The DRP test should be monitored and evaluated to ensure that it is proceeding as planned. Any problems or areas for improvement should be identified and documented.

### Analyzing and Reporting on the DRP Test Results
- **Identifying areas for improvement:** The DRP test results should be analyzed to identify any areas for improvement. This may include gaps or weaknesses in the plan, or procedures that need to be modified.
- **Making changes to the DRP:** Any necessary changes to the DRP should be made based on the test results. For example, if the test revealed that the notification process was not effective, the DRP should be updated to improve the notification process. Make sure to consider existing change management procedures.
- **Reporting on the test results to stakeholders:** A report on the DRP test results should be prepared and submitted to key stakeholders. The report should include the test objectives, results, and any recommendations for improvement.

### Additional Topics

- **Best practices for DRP testing:**
	- Involve all key stakeholders in the testing process
	- Develop realistic test scenarios
	- Test all aspects of the DRP
	- Monitor and evaluate the test closely
	- Make changes to the DRP based on the test results
	- Conduct DRP tests regularly
- **DRP testing frequency:** How often you need to test your DRP will depend on the size and complexity of your organization, as well as the level of risk you are willing to accept. However, it is generally recommended to test your DRP at least once a year, and more often if you are in a high-risk industry.

	- Natural disasters
	- Human error
	- Cyberattacks
	- Economic downturn
	- Political instability
- The risk assessment should also assess the **likelihood and impact** of each risk. This will help the organization to prioritize its risks and to develop effective BC strategies.
- **Why is a risk assessment important?** A risk assessment is important because it helps organizations to develop effective BC strategies.
- **Different types of risk assessments:**
	- Qualitative risk assessments: rely on subjective judgments to identify and assess risks. They are typically less expensive and time-consuming to conduct than quantitative risk assessments, but they can be less accurate.
	- Quantitative risk assessments: use objective data to identify and assess risks. They are typically more expensive and time-consuming to conduct than qualitative risk assessments, but they can be more accurate.
	- Hybrid risk assessments: combine qualitative and quantitative methods to identify and assess risks. They are typically a good compromise between the cost, time, and accuracy of qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.
- **How to conduct a risk assessment:**
	- Identify their assets, vulnerabilities, and threats
		- Assets are anything that has value to your organization, such as people, property, information, and systems.
		- Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in your assets that could be exploited by threats.
		- Threats are events or actors that could cause harm to your assets.
		- To identify your assets, vulnerabilities, and threats, you can use a variety of methods, such as:
			- Asset inventory: Create an inventory of all of your assets, including information about their value, location, and dependencies.
